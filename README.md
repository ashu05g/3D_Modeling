This adorable cupcake model is a playful, cartoonish dessert character that I designed for a course assignment. The project was crafted in Blender using:

- **🛠 Sculpting and Modeling:** I started with basic shapes and refined them to create smooth, rounded surfaces that give the cupcake a cute, soft look.
- **🎨 Materials and Texturing:** The cupcake’s colors are carefully selected to look both tasty and friendly. Pink cheeks and sprinkles were added for extra charm.
- **💡 Lighting and Rendering:** A simple lighting setup enhances the cupcake’s colors and highlights its facial expression.

This model is perfect for use in animations, children’s projects, or illustrations due to its friendly design. 🍰

In this project, I created a realistic **wine glass** model that showcases transparency, refraction, and reflections.

- **🔍 Precision Modeling:** The glass structure was carefully sculpted to mimic the subtle thickness and curves of real glassware.
- **💎 Material Setup:** The glass material was created with Blender’s transparency and glossiness settings, and the liquid was given a subtle yellow tint to emulate white wine.
- **💡 Lighting and Rendering:** Using the Cycles engine, I adjusted light settings to make the glass shine and capture reflections realistically.

This project helped me explore Blender’s material nodes for achieving glass effects and creating realistic renderings. 🥂

This model was inspired by traditional Japanese stone lanterns and combines both stylized and realistic elements, making it ideal for game assets or animation backgrounds.

- **🏗 Modeling and Design:** The lantern structure was assembled from multiple parts, including a base, body, and roof, inspired by authentic Japanese designs.
- **🖌 Texturing and Shading:** Hand-painted textures were applied to create a stylized look. Japanese characters were added for authenticity, giving it a mystical feel.
- **✨ Internal Glow Effect:** I used an emission shader to give the lantern a soft internal glow, making it appear as if it's gently illuminating from within.

This model was a fantastic exercise in **UV unwrapping** and hand-painting textures. 🌌

The Sci-Fi Wind Turbine model is a futuristic turbine concept designed using **Plasticity**. The model showcases intricate details and structured design, blending hard-surface modeling techniques with sci-fi aesthetics. Here’s a breakdown of the approach:

- **🔧 Modeling Precision:** The turbine’s structure uses precise extrusions and solid objects to form the intricate fan blade design, capturing a sci-fi-inspired industrial feel.
- **🔩 Surface Details:** Various extrusions and cuts add depth, creating a layered effect that enhances the turbine’s mechanical complexity.
- **📐 Structural Symmetry:** The model focuses on radial symmetry, essential for turbine designs, ensuring both visual appeal and functionality.
- **🎨 Shading and Visualization:** By switching between solid and wireframe views, I explored the turbine’s inner structures, highlighting the meticulous detailing within each layer.

This project was a fantastic exploration of Plasticity’s capabilities in creating complex mechanical assets for futuristic environments.

## 💻 Software & Tools

- **Blender**: Primary tool for modeling, sculpting, texturing, and rendering all projects. Blender’s versatile tools allowed me to bring these designs to life with precision and creativity.
- **Plasticity**: Used to enhance some model edges and surface details. It provided additional control over hard-surface modeling aspects.
- **Rendering Engines**:
  - **Cycles**: Ideal for realistic renders (especially for glass and reflective surfaces).
  - **Eevee**: Used for fast previews and some stylized renders.
